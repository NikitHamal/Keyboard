# KEYBOARD_STATUS.md - NikitHamal/Keyboard

Single status file for the Android keyboard. Extend in place.

## Architecture (unchanged, see AGENTS.md)
Kotlin + Compose IME (`NepaliImeService`) + settings app. TinyLM inference is pure Kotlin
(`tlm/TlmNet.kt`, weights packed as `*.tlmw` by `tools/pack_tlm.py`), no onnxruntime, no network permission.
Assets track `NikitHamal/transliterationlm` artifacts (read-only upstream; model training is another agent's job).

## Done earlier (do not redo)
- IME opens: Compose lifecycle / ViewModelStore / SavedStateRegistry owners on the IME DecorView and ComposeView,
  `performAttach()` + `performRestore(null)` before RESUMED, fixed-height input frame, init-order NPE fix.
- TinyLM + lexicon load off the main thread (`ImeRuntime.ensureTlm/ensureLexicon`), LRU cache in `TlmEngine`,
  conflated candidate worker with generation tags.
- `CrashLog` global handler + Diagnostics screen (crash log viewer, test sandbox) in the settings app.

## This session
- BUG FIXED: words were typed twice (`Helloहेल्लो meroमेरो`). Cause: `commitComposition` called
  `finishComposingText()` and then `commitText()`, so the Latin composing text stayed in the field and the
  Devanagari word was appended. Now a single in-place `commitText`. Backspacing the last roman letter also clears
  the composing region instead of leaving one character behind.
- Composing region now shows Devanagari (rule-based preview instantly, upgraded in place to the TinyLM pick when the
  model answers, `CompositionController.applyBest`). Strip shows alternatives. Space/chip commit replaces it.
- Gboard-exact symbol pages: `?123` -> digits row + punctuation, `=\<` flips to page 2 (currency/maths/brackets,
  previously unreachable), `ABC` returns. Labels no longer truncate (`Sym...`).
- Fonts lighter: key caps Regular, strip Regular/Medium, settings SemiBold->Medium; Noto Sans Devanagari is now a
  single variable font (Light..Bold) replacing three static files.
- Slimmer chips: strip candidates are small 12dp tonal rectangles, chevron 32dp, toolbar buttons 30dp, strip 44dp,
  key gap 4dp / radius 9dp, zero shadows (preview bubble shadow removed).
- Settings: choice groups wrap (FlowRow) instead of truncating "System d..."/"AMOLED ...", palette picker is a 2x2
  grid of compact tiles, devanagari sample uses the Devanagari font.
- New launcher icon: flat teal tonal field, cream keycap with Devanagari ka + saffron "A" badge, themed monochrome layer.
- `direct_ne.tsv` synced from transliterationlm (slang table grew 431 -> more rows).

## Next ideas
- Byakaran (grammar) chip in the strip from the sentence layer.
- Per-key long-press hints for the Devanagari layout; trackpad scrub haptics tuning.


## Session: realtime typing pass (latency + upstream sync)
Upstream `transliterationlm` @ 106e9a0: assets (`lex_ne.tsv`, `direct_ne.tsv`, config, vocab, ctx vocab) were already identical;
the engine rules were not. Ported into `tlm/TlmEngine.kt`: sorry/सरी, उन्छु->उँछु, काठमाडौँ direct fix, पानी/पनि and बुबा
clause rules, छु/ला bias, short-nasal penalty, ब/व guard, extra honorific verbs, ctx skip for k/baba/paani.

Measured with the JVM harness (`tools/tlm_jvm_check/LatencyBench.kt`, 2 vCPU x86, warm): per-keystroke rank went from
~19.6 ms avg (77 ms max) to ~7 ms avg / 13 ms p90 with byte-identical output on 1200 roman inputs x 5 contexts
(`Parity.kt`: diff of old vs new engine = 0 lines).

Engine (`tlm/TlmNet.kt`): 4-accumulator matvec, table GELU, allocation-free decoder step with per-thread scratch,
candidate scoring split across up to 3 helper threads (own KV cache each), allocation-free beam search, context scorer skips
padding rows, cancellable beam (`TlmStale`), deep request reuses a shallow result when no beam was needed, Keys without
per-word Regex compilation (lexicon load ~2x faster), common-word warm-up on a background thread (`TlmLoader.warmup`).

Android pipeline:
- `CandidateEngine`: dedicated display-priority worker (`util/WorkerThreads`), results posted to main with a Handler (the
  worker never waits for the UI), beam search aborts when a newer key arrives, `awaitPublished()` for Space.
- Space never runs the model on the main thread any more (it used to block on the engine lock): it takes the worker's result
  for the current word (<=45 ms wait) and otherwise commits exactly what is on screen.
- `CompositionController` keeps a mirror of the text left of the caret, so `getTextBeforeCursor` (blocking binder call) is no
  longer made on word starts, shift refresh, backspace or prediction. Invalidated on focus change, caret jump, Enter action.
- Backspace inside a word re-shows the model spelling already computed for that prefix on the same frame.
- One UI state publish per key instead of two; suggestion strip hidden no longer disables model upgrade of the composing word.
- Settings Home shows rolling keystroke latency (`util/TlmStats`).
- New launcher icon: crimson flat field, cream keycap with real Noto Sans Devanagari na outline in front of a saffron keycap with
  Outfit "a" (glyphs cut out with even-odd fill, themed monochrome layer uses the same geometry).

## Next ideas
- On-device check of p95 latency (Home -> Engine card). If still high on low-end devices lower `TlmTuning.maxHelperThreads`.
- Baseline profile for the inference kernels.
